## A Note from Founder

> **SIMPLE Test** (Skills, Interests, Motivations, Preferences, Leadership, Experience) was born in 2020 from a simple realization: Indian students deserve career guidance that understands *their* reality. Having seen countless students struggle with foreign tests that don't account for our education system, family values, or job market realities, we built this open-source assessment specifically for Indian contexts.
> 
> Over 5,000 students later, SIMPLE Test continues to evolve - now combining traditional career theory with modern AI-era skills assessment. This isn't just another quiz; it's a community-powered tool that grows smarter with every contribution. Join us in making career guidance accessible and relevant for every Indian student.
